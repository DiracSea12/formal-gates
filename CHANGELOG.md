# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Discover independent review gates from package-local `gates/*.md` files.
- Compose every gate task from one shared reviewer base and one gate-specific
  prompt.
- Replace the receipt/closure workflow with one resumable run-state file and
  one retained seal or abort summary.
- Run QA Execution and all discovered independent gates in parallel on the
  current native VCS snapshot.
- Use Git, SVN, P4, or another named VCS directly for cumulative and repair
  comparisons.
- Let seal finalize a run with any selected combination of QA and gate results,
  including none, without treating review completion or PASS as a prerequisite.

### Removed

- Fixed four-gate registries, extension manifests, prompt copies, context
  bundles, receipt and closure graphs, recursive Carry chains, generated
  handoffs, detailed gate-state trees, and their compatibility paths.
- The duplicate `formal-gates-validate` command, old evidence demos, and the
  standalone prompt-pollution pattern catalog.
